# Taskbar Separators
Basic icons to divide the Windows taskbar

Download in the releases section

The exe is a blank C++ program that does nothing and closes itself

## Adding More
1. Copy one of the shortcut files
2. Right-click the new shortcut -> properties -> change or add a number to the end of the target box

The number can't be the same as one used by any of the other shortcuts, or it won't be able to get pinned to the taskbar.
