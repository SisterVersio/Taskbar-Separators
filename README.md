Pin to your taskbar like any other program.

If you need more, just copy one of the .exe files and make sure it has a unique name.

## Extra Info
Icons can be changed by creating your own shortcuts with your chosen icon file.

Each file is just essentially a blank program that immediately closes, not meant to be run, but if you accidentally click them you shouldn't have to close any windows.
You can build them from code yourself if it makes you feel safer. (doNothing.cpp)
